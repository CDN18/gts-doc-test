Federated social media software.

GoToSocial is a Fediverse server project, written in Golang. It provides an alternative to existing projects such as [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/), [Pleroma](https://pleroma.social/), [Friendica](https://friendica.net), [PixelFed](https://pixelfed.org/) etc.

One of the key differences between GoToSocial and those other projects is that GoToSocial doesn't include an integrated front-end (ie., a webapp). Instead, like the Matrix.org's [Synapse](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse) project, it provides only a server implementation and a well-documented API. On this API, developers are free to build any front-end implementation or mobile application that they wish.

Because the server implementation is as generic and flexible/configurable as possible, GoToSocial provides the basis for many different types of social media experience, whether Tumblr-like, Facebook-like, or Twitter-like.

## Goals

The first goal of the project is to implement a feature set comparable to Mastodon: server logic, federation logic, and a client API that's a superset of the Mastodon API described [here](https://docs.joinmastodon.org/).

Once the client API is implemented, it should allow existing Mastodon apps like [Tusky](https://tusky.app/) and [Whalebird](https://whalebird.social/en/desktop/contents) to work with GoToSocial.

After that, custom features will be added that will necessitate expanding the API.

## Wishlist

Among other things:

* Reputation-based 'slow' federation.
* Granular post settings.
* Local-only posting.
* Easily-configurable character limit.
* Groups and group posting.

## Implementation Status

For an up-to-date view on progress made towards a v1.0.0 release, see [here](./PROGRESS.md).
