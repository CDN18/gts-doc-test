Federated social media software.

GoToSocial is a Fediverse server project, written in Golang. It provides a lightweight, customizable, and safety-focused alternative to existing projects such as [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/), [Pleroma](https://pleroma.social/), [Friendica](https://friendica.net), [PixelFed](https://pixelfed.org/) etc.

One of the key differences between GoToSocial and those other projects is that GoToSocial doesn't include an integrated client front-end (ie., a webapp).

Instead, like the Matrix.org's [Synapse](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse) project, it provides only a server implementation, some static pages, and a well-documented API. On top of this API, developers are free to build any front-end implementation or mobile application that they wish.

Because the server implementation is as generic and flexible/configurable as possible, GoToSocial provides the basis for many different types of social media experience, whether Tumblr-like, Facebook-like, or Twitter-like.

## Features

A grab-bag of things that are already included or will be included in the first release(s) of the project:

* Mastodon API compatible, which means full support for apps you already know and love like [Tusky](https://tusky.app/) and [Pinafore](https://pinafore.social/).
* Various federation modes:
  * 'Normal' federation
  * Allowlist-only federation
  * Zero federation.
* Granular post settings:
  * Local-only posts.
  * Rebloggable/boostable toggle.
  * 'Likeable' toggle.
  * 'Replyable' toggle.
* Easy customizability for admins, without messing around in the source code:
  * Adjustable post length.
  * Media upload size settings.
* Built-in, automatic LetsEncrypt support (no messing around with Nginx or Certbot).
* Good performance on lower-powered machines like Raspberry Pi, old laptops and tiny VPSes (the test VPS has 1gb of ram and 1 cpu core).
* Subscribeable and shareable allow/denylists for federation.
* Strict privacy enforcement for posts and strict blocking logic.
* HTTP signature authentication by default (equivalent to Mastodon's [Secure Mode](https://docs.joinmastodon.org/spec/security/#http) being always-on).
* No external dependencies apart from a database. Binary + static assets only.

### Wishlist

These cool things will be implemented if time allows (because we really want them):

* Groups and group posting!
* Reputation-based 'slow' federation.
* User-selectable custom templates for rendering public posts:
  * Twitter-style
  * Blogpost
  * Gallery
  * Etc.

## Status

Work began on the project around February 2021, and the project is still in prerelease.

At this point, GoToSocial is already deployable and very useable, and it federates cleanly with other Fediverse servers.

For a detailed view on what's implemented and what's not, and progress made towards a first v0.1.0 (beta) release, see [here](./PROGRESS.md).

## Getting Started

Proper documentation for running and maintaining GoToSocial will be forthcoming in the first release.

For now (if you want to run it pre-alpha, like a beast), check out the [quick and dirty getting started guide](./GETTINGSTARTED.md).
