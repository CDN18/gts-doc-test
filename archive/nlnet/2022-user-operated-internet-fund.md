This document is the application on behalf of GoToSocial for funding from the [NLnet](https://nlnet.nl) [User Operated Internet Fund](https://nlnet.nl/useroperated/), June 2022 edition. See [here](https://nlnet.nl/propose/).

> Abstract: Can you explain the whole project and its expected outcome(s). (you have 1200 characters)

GoToSocial (GtS) is an ActivityPub social network server, written in Golang. It provides a lightweight and safety-focused entryway into the Fediverse, and is comparable to (but distinct from) existing projects such as Mastodon, Pleroma, Friendica, and PixelFed. GtS began development in February 2021. It is still alpha software, but is already deployable and very useable, and it federates cleanly with many other Fediverse servers.

GtS addresses concerns about privacy and safety by providing instance admins the ability to pool their work aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa

GtS also places a high value on ease of deployment and maintenance; this means low system requirements, simple configuration, minimal external dependencies, and clear documentation. Our goal is to make it easy + affordable for self-hosting newcomers to set up a Fediverse server on low-powered (or even solar-powered) equipment they might have lying around at home.

> Have you been involved with projects or organisations relevant to this project before? And if so, can you tell us a bit about your contributions? (Optional) This can help us determine if you are the right person to undertake this effort.

I am the founder and de facto current lead developer of the GoToSocial project. Over the last year or so I have put (approximately) 1,000+ hours of work into the project. This involved many, many hours of writing code and documentation, communicating with other contributors and other project maintainers, deploying infrastructure for project builds and discussion, project planning, and answering user questions. I never guessed when I began working on GoToSocial that I would become so passionately committed to it. Along the way, I've been encouraged both by the successes of the codebase, and by the enthusiastic response to the project from the Fediverse.

## Requested Support

> Requested Amount (between 5,000 and 50,000 euro)

> Explain what the requested budget will be used for?
> Does the project have other funding sources, both past and present?
> (If you want, you can in addition attach a budget at the bottom of the form)
> Explain costs for hardware, human labor (including rates used), travel cost to technical meetings, etc.

The budget will be used to fund the remaining alpha portion of development, and bring GoToSocial into the beta phase.

> Compare your own project with existing or historical efforts. (e.g. what is new, more thorough, or otherwise different)

Unlike other federated server projects, GtS doesn't include an integrated webapp. Instead, it provides a generic backend server implementation, some beautiful static pages for profiles and posts, and a well-documented API. On top of this API, web developers are encouraged to build any front-end implementation or mobile application that they wish, whether Tumblr-like, Twitter-like, or something else entirely.

> What are significant technical challenges you expect to solve during the project, if any? (optional but recommended)

> Describe the ecosystem of the project, and how you will engage with relevant actors and promote the outcomes?

## Attachments

> Attachments: add any additional information about the project that may help us to gain more insight into the proposed effort, for instance a more detailed task description, a justification of costs or relevant endorsements. Attachments should only contain background information, please make sure that the proposal without attachments is self-contained and concise. Don't waste too much time on this. Really.
