// It should be served as a PATCH at /api/v1/accounts/update_credentials
//
// TODO: this can be optimized massively by building up a picture of what we want the new account
// details to be, and then inserting it all in the database at once. As it is, we do queries one-by-one
// which is not gonna make the database very happy when lots of requests are going through.
// This way it would also be safer because the update won't happen until *all* the fields are validated.
// Otherwise we risk doing a partial update and that's gonna cause probllleeemmmsss.
