# go-errors

powerful errors library with a simple API that allows:
- accessing all the standard library errors functions
- wrapping of errors
- adding values to errors, in a similar manner to contexts
- including calling function prefix when tag=errcaller is set
- including stacktrace with error when tag=errtrace is set
